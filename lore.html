      <h2 class="dragon-title fire-glow glow-pulse">🔥 The Legend of Fire Dragon</h2>
      <p>
        Forged in the heart of sleeping volcanoes, the Fire Dragon commands flame and fury. It is said their breath can melt stone and their gaze can ignite the air itself.
      </p>

      <h2 class="dragon-title ice-glow glow-pulse">❄️ Ice Wyrm's Whisper</h2>
      <p>
        Hidden beneath ancient glaciers, the Ice Wyrm dreams in silence. Few have seen them and lived to tell the tale — their beauty is matched only by their deadly chill.
      </p>

      <h2 class="dragon-title storm-glow glow-pulse">⚡ Storm Serpent Prophecy</h2>
      <p>
        These sky-born serpents ride the lightning and speak in thunder. Legends say they can split mountains with a scream and vanish in a flash of light.
      </p>

      <h2 class="dragon-title nature-glow glow-pulse">🌿 The Forest Guardian</h2>
      <p>
        Gentle but powerful, this dragon protects the sacred groves. Trees bloom in its wake, but beware — disturb the forest, and the Guardian awakens.
      </p>

      <h2 class="dragon-title shadow-glow glow-pulse">🖤 Shadow Wyvern Curse</h2>
      <p>
        Born from forgotten magic and dark whispers, the Shadow Wyvern hides in eternal dusk. Its presence brings fear, its flight — silence. Some say it was never alive.
